Widgetbook is a sandbox for building widgets and screens in isolation. It helps you develop and share hard-to-reach states and edge cases without needing to run your whole app. Inspired by Storybook.js.

## Open-Source Widgetbook

- 🧱 **Build UI components and pages in isolation**. Implement components and pages without needing to fuss with data, APIs, or business logic.
- 👀 **Mock hard-to-reach edge cases**. Render widgets in key states that are tricky to reproduce in an app. Then save those states as use-case to revisit during development, testing, and QA.
- 📙 **Catalog all of your widgets**. Create your own widget library providing you with a great overview of what you have already built.
