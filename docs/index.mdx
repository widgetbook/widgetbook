# Overview

Widgetbook is a sandbox for building **widgets and screens in isolation**. It helps you develop and share hard-to-reach states and edge cases without needing to run your whole app. Widgetbook is [open-source](https://github.com/widgetbook/widgetbook) and **free** to use.

Still don't get what Widgetbook really is? Maybe [the Flutter team can explain it better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-g2KYjiPzzA) _(note that this is a very old version of Widgetbook, and the UI has changed since then)_.

## The Problem

While developing widgets or screens, you have probably faced one of the following problems:

- **Hard-to-reach states:** You need to test a widget in a specific state (e.g. error, loading, etc.) but it is hard to reach that state in your app.
- **Time consuming:** You need to run your whole app to test a single widget or screen, and even spend more time to test in in different configurations (e.g. dark mode, different locales, etc.).
- **API/Datasource dependencies:** You need to mock data or APIs to test your screens, which is time-consuming and error-prone, and it is even not always possible to do that.
- **Collaboration:** You need to share your widgets with your design team or other developers, but it is hard to do that without a proper documentation or cataloging system.

## The Solution: Widgetbook

With Widgetbook you can **build UI in isolation** without the depending on any external data source or API. This allows you to:

- **Easily test your widgets** in different **states** (e.g. error, loading, etc.) via [Knobs](/knobs/overview), and **configurations** (e.g. dark mode, different locales, etc.) via [Addons](/addons).
- **Mock your data** so you can test your widgets without the need to run your whole app (learn more about [Mocking](/guides/mocking)).
- **Catalog your widgets and screens** in a single place, so you can easily share them with all your team members (e.g. developers, designers, product managers, QA testers).

  > We build new features by starting with Widgetbook, allowing us to
  immediately develop the UI in isolation and see how new components behave.
  Building in isolation is especially helpful for larger components and screens
  that handle various data states â€” like loading, loaded, or error. Before
  Widgetbook, testing error states was time-consuming because theyâ€™re naturally
  hard to reproduce; the data often comes from sources we canâ€™t easily control.
  But with Widgetbookâ€™s isolation-first approach, we can inject mocked data and
  test all component states. Once a component is ready, other developers can
  easily explore its different variations. â€” Arthur Schenk, Mobile Team Lead at
  Salto
