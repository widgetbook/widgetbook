# Overview

Widgetbook is a sandbox for building **widgets and screens in isolation**. It helps you develop and share hard-to-reach states and edge cases without needing to run your whole app. Widgetbook is [open-source](https://github.com/widgetbook/widgetbook) and **free** to use.

Still don't get what Widgetbook really is? Maybe [the Flutter team can explain it better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-g2KYjiPzzA) _(note that this is a very old version of Widgetbook, and the UI has changed since then)_.

## The Problem

While developing widgets or screens, you have probably faced one of the following problems:

- **Hard-to-reach states:** You need to test a widget in a specific state (e.g. error, loading, etc.) but it is hard to reach that state in your app.
- **Time consuming:** You need to run your whole app to test a single widget or screen, and even spend more time to test in in different configurations (e.g. dark mode, different locales, etc.).
- **API/Datasource dependencies:** You need to mock data or APIs to test your screens, which is time-consuming and error-prone, and it is even not always possible to do that.
- **Collaboration:** You need to share your widgets with your design team or other developers, but it is hard to do that without a proper documentation or cataloging system.

## The Solution: Widgetbook

With Widgetbook you can **build UI in isolation** without the depending on any external data source or API. This allows you to:

- **Easily test your widgets** in different **states** (e.g. error, loading, etc.) via [Knobs](/knobs), and **configurations** (e.g. dark mode, different locales, etc.) via [Addons](/addons).
- **Mock your data** so you can test your widgets without the need to run your whole app (learn more about [Mocking](/guides/mocking)).
- **Catalog your widgets and screens** in a single place, so you can easily share them with all your team members (e.g. developers, designers, product managers, QA testers).
