# What are Stories?

A Story is a specific state or variant of a design component _(or a Flutter widget)_. It is a way to showcase a component in different scenarios.

## Stories for Components

Your design system will usually have multiple components, and each component will have multiple stories. For example, a button component might have stories for different states like `Primary`, `Secondary`, `Disabled` etc.

```dart title="components/lib/button.dart"
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

enum ButtonState {
  primary,
  secondary,
  disabled,
}

class Button extends StatelessWidget {
  final String text;
  final ButtonState state;

  const Button({
    super.key,
    required this.text,
    required this.state,
  });

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Implementation of the button based on state
  }
}
```

```dart title="widgetbook/lib/button.stories.dart"
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:components/button.dart';

part 'button.stories.g.dart';

final meta = Meta<Button>();

final $Primary = _Story(
  args: _Args(
    text: StringArg('Primary'),
    state: EnumArg<ButtonState>(ButtonState.primary, values: ButtonState.values),
  ),
)

final $Secondary = _Story(
  args: _Args(
    text: StringArg('Secondary'),
    state: EnumArg<ButtonState>(ButtonState.secondary, values: ButtonState.values),
  ),
)

final $Disabled = _Story(
  args: _Args(
    text: StringArg('Disabled'),
    state: EnumArg<ButtonState>(ButtonState.disabled, values: ButtonState.values),
  ),
)
```

## Stories for Screens

A screen is a composition of multiple components but as you move up the component hierarchy toward the screen level, you deal with more complexity. That's why it is **recommended** to catalog your screens in Widgetbook to be able to test them in isolation.

There are two common patterns for building screens:

1. **Pure Screens**: Screens that are fully presentational and don't depend on external data or services. You can create a story for them like any other component.
2. **Contained Screens**: Screens that depend on external data or services. Check out our [mocking guide](/stories/mocking) to know how to handle such screens.

## Component Path

You can change the navigation path of your stories by using the `path` parameter in `Meta` as follows:

<Info>
  If you wrap a folder name in **square brackets**, it will be treated as a
  **category** in the navigation path.
</Info>

```dart title="widgetbook/lib/button.stories.dart"
final meta = Meta<Button>(
  path: 'components/button',
);
```
