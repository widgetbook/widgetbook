# Generate Stories with LLMs

<YouTube id="hrehRP54YuA" />

Writing stories for components can be time-consuming — especially when dealing with many components in different states and configurations.
Large Language Models (LLMs) can help automate this process by generating stories based on a component's properties and behavior.

## Recommendations

For best results, consider the following tips:

- Use a recent LLM optimized for code generation.
- Work in IDEs like [Cursor](https://www.cursor.so/) or [Void](https://voideditor.com), or use extensions like GitHub Copilot to enable agentic LLM workflows. These tools provide better context awareness and integration with your codebase.
- Focus on one component/file at a time to give the LLM a clear scope.
- Always review and test the generated code before using it.
