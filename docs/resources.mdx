## Presentation

Often our users need to create a presentation to convince their team to use Widgetbook. That's why we created the following presentation that you can use to explain your team the value and show them how easy it is to setup the open source Widgetbook as well as Widgetbook Cloud. Please find the link to [our Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZIhWEJovIaLJQn-4ZYq8n8miJe8QwQUr63DJ6FjwWPE/edit?usp=sharing) here. To make best use of the slides, feel free to make a copy of them with one of your Google workspace accounts (file > make a copy) and include them in your presentation.
