# Automatic Documentation

Widgetbook generates interactive documentation for your Flutter components directly from your code using a flexible `DocBlock` system.

## Benefits

- **🚀 Zero Configuration Required:** Works out of the box. Your components and stories are your documentation.
- **📖 Interactive & Live:** Shows live examples of your components with all variations and configurations.
- **🎨 Fully Customizable:** Add, remove, or replace blocks to match your team's needs.
- **🔄 Always Up-to-Date:** Generated from your code, so it stays in sync with your implementation.
- **📝 Rich Content Support:** Combine component names, doc comments, live stories, argument tables, and custom content.

## Main Features

### DocBlocks
Documentation is built using composable `DocBlock` widgets. Each block renders a specific piece of documentation - from titles and text to live component previews and argument tables.

### Component Documentation
Every component gets a documentation page with:
- Component name and description
- Live story examples
- Configurable arguments
- All available variations

### Hierarchical Customization
Customize at two levels:
- **Global Level**: Set defaults for all components using `Config`
- **Component Level**: Override specific components using the `Meta` tag

## Getting Started

Widgetbook uses this default documentation structure:

```dart
List<DocBlock> defaultDocsBuilder() {
  return [
    const ComponentNameDocBlock(),
    const DartCommentDocBlock(),
    const StoriesDocBlock(),
  ];
}
```

This shows the component name, its documentation comments, and all available stories including a table of their default Args.
