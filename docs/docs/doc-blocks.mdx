# DocBlocks

DocBlocks are composable widgets that render different parts of your component documentation. 
Each block serves a specific purpose including displaying component names, doc comments, live story examples, argument tables, and more.

## Core DocBlocks

### ComponentNameDocBlock

Displays the name of the current component as a title in the documentation panel.

**Usage:**
```dart
const ComponentNameDocBlock()
```

### DartCommentDocBlock

Displays the Dart documentation comments for the current component. 
Documentation comments are automatically extracted from your source code by the build_runner.

**Usage:**
```dart
const DartCommentDocBlock()
```

### StoriesDocBlock

Displays all stories defined for the current component including their names, live previews, and a table displaying the default `Arg` values. 

**Usage:**
```dart
const StoriesDocBlock()
```

### PrimaryStoryDocBlock

Displays only the first story for the component. Useful for highlighting the main example.

**Usage:**
```dart
const PrimaryStoryDocBlock()
```

## Text & Layout DocBlocks

### TitleDocBlock

Displays text as a large title using `headlineLarge` text style.

**Usage:**
```dart
TitleDocBlock(title: 'My Component')
```

### SubtitleDocBlock

Displays text as a medium-sized subtitle using `headlineMedium` text style.

**Usage:**
```dart
SubtitleDocBlock(title: 'Examples')
```

### TextDocBlock

Displays a block of text using the default body text style.

**Usage:**
```dart
const TextDocBlock('This is a description of my component.')
```

## Composition

### ComposerDocBlock

Stacks multiple `DocBlock` widgets vertically with consistent spacing. 

**Usage:**
```dart
ComposerDocBlock(
  children: [
    const TitleDocBlock(title: 'Button'),
    const TextDocBlock('A customizable button component.'),
    const PrimaryStoryDocBlock(),
  ],
)
```

### WidgetDocBlock

Embeds any custom Flutter widget into your documentation.

**Usage:**
```dart
WidgetDocBlock(
  Container(
    padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16),
    color: Colors.blue.shade50,
    child: const Text('Custom widget in docs'),
  ),
)
```
