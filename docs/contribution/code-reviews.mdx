# Code Reviews

The review process is an essential part of maintaining and improving the overall
quality of the project. Here's what to expect:

1. **Review Phase**: Once your PR is submitted, it enters the review queue. One
   or more maintainers or experienced contributors will review your code.
2. **Feedback Loop**: Reviewers might provide feedback, asking for changes,
   improvements, or clarifications. This isn't a critique of your skills but an
   essential step to ensure the project's integrity and consistency.
3. **Adjustments**: You might need to adjust your code based on the feedback.
   Update your PR accordingly and notify reviewers once the changes are made.
4. **Approval**: Once all concerns are addressed and reviewers are satisfied,
   your PR will be approved.
5. **Merging**: An approved PR will merge into the project.

_Note_: Patience is key during the review process. Everyone's primary goal is to
ensure the best quality for the project.
