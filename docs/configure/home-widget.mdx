# Home Widget

The home widget is a widget that is shown on startup when no use-case is selected.
This widget does not inherit from the `appBuilder` or the `addons`;
Meaning that if `Theme.of(context)` is called inside this widget, then it will use Widgetbook's `lightTheme` or `darkTheme`,
and not the `Theme` from the `appBuilder` or the `ThemeAddon`.

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Widgetbook(
    home: const MyCustomHomeWidget(),
    // ...
  );
}
```
