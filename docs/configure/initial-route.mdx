# Initial Route

Initial routes can be used to pick the home page that is used on first launch by providing a `initialRoute` parameter to the `Config`.

<Info>
  To easily get the exact route for a story, run your Widgetbook project on
  web, and copy the value of the URL, then paste it as the value of the
  `initialRoute` parameter.

```dart title=widgetbook/lib/widgetbook.config.dart
final config = Config(
  // ...
  initialRoute: '?path=introduction/home-story',
);
```
