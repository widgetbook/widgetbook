# Initial Route

Initial routes can be used to pick the home page that is used on first launch by providing a `initialRoute` parameter to the `Widgetbook` constructor.

<Info>
  To easily get the exact route for a use-case, run your Widgetbook project on
  web, and copy the value of the URL, then paste it as the value of the
  `initialRoute` parameter.

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Widgetbook(
    initialRoute: '?path=introduction/home-use-case',
    // ...
  );
}
```
