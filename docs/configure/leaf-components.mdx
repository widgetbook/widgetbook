# Leaf Components

When a component has a single use-case, it's called a leaf component. By default, Widgetbook hides the use-case of the leaf component and displays the component directly in the navigation tree. This helps to declutter the navigation tree and make it easier to navigate.

To enable or disable the leaf component behavior, you can use the `enableLeafComponent` parameter in the `Widgetbook` constructor.

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Widgetbook(
    enableLeafComponent: false, // defaults to true
    // ...
  );
}
```
