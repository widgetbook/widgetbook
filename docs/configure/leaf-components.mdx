# Leaf Components

When a component has a single story, it's called a leaf component. By default, Widgetbook hides the story of the leaf component and displays the component directly in the navigation tree. This helps to declutter the navigation tree and make it easier to navigate.

To enable or disable the leaf component behavior, you can use the `enableLeafComponent` parameter in the `Config`.

```dart title=widgetbook/lib/widgetbook.config.dart
final config = Config(
  // ...
  enableLeafComponent: true, // Set to false to disable leaf components
);
```
