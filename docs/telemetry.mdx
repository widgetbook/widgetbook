# Telemetry

Widgetbook Generator collects and reports **anonymous** usage information.
This information is essential to figure out how we should improve our package.
Telemetry does not collect any personal information.

## Opting-out

To opt-out from telemetry:

1. Create a `build.yaml` file at the root of your project (next to your `pubspec.yaml`).
1. Add the following content to the file:

   ```yaml
   targets:
     $default:
       builders:
         widgetbook_generator:telemetry:
           enabled: false
   ```

## Collected Data

A new telemetry report after you run the `build_runner build` command,
if the `*.directories.g.dart` file has changed.

We send the following information, which **has no personal data**:

1. The package name.
1. Unique **hashed** anonymous ID based on your git config email.
1. The SHA of the first commit in the repository, to identify distinct projects.
1. The repository's owner URL (e.g. `https://github.com/widgetbook`).
1. Information about Widgetbook Components like:
   - The number of components.
   - The number of components with various counts of use-cases.
   - The packages' names where the components were defined.
