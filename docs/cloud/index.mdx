## The Problem

- **Designer / Developer collaboration:** Designers often don't review the implemented UI before release, leading to inconsistencies and poor user experience. Current UI reviews are unstructured, causing misunderstandings and design inconsistencies.

- **No automated Golden Testing:** Detecting UI changes is difficult without automated tests. Golden Tests can help but are often flaky and time-consuming to write manually.

- **No Figma integration:** Designers struggle to compare Flutter implementations with their original Figma designs without integration.

- **Cumbersome hosting setup:** Self-hosting Widgetbook requires setup and maintenance, usually allowing only one branch or the latest commit to be hosted.

## The Solution: Widgetbook Cloud

Widgetbook Cloud addresses these challenges by offering a structured review platform for the entire product team.
