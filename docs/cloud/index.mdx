## The Problem

After submitting a PR for review, both you and the reviewer have no idea which **UI changes** were made. The reviewer has to do the following to make sure that everything works as excepted:

1. Check out the PR locally.
2. Run the app in the simulator or on desktop.
3. Execute the required flow (e.g. authentication) to reach the desired screen to review.
4. Test out the screen in different states (e.g. empty, error, loading, etc.) or different configurations (e.g. dark mode, different locales, etc.).

That process is time-consuming that most reviewers skip it, and just settle down for only reviewing the code. By skipping the UI review process, the risk of introducing UI regressions increases significantly.

## The Solution: Widgetbook Cloud

Widgetbook Cloud can help you doing **UI Reviews in your browser** without the need to check out the PR locally or the need to write any code to test the UI. You can easily see all the changes made in the PR and test them in different states or configurations.

  > Widgetbook is integrated and running in our build CI pipelines. So, every
  merge request triggers Widgetbook Builds to run the snapshot tests. If we made
  changes in code, Widgetbook shows which components stayed the same and which
  components had visual adjustments making it trivial to review visual changes
  and get the code merged. — Arthur Schenk, Mobile Team Lead at Salto
