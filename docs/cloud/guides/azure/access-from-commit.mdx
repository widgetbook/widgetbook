# Access builds from Azure commit statuses

Widgetbook Cloud links builds to [Azure commit statuses](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/git/statuses) so accessing Widgetbook builds integrates seamlessly with your Azure workflow.

## Prerequisites

Linking builds to Azure commit statuses requires API access to your Azure repository.
By [connecting a Widgetbook project to a Azure repository](/cloud/projects/connect#connect-project) you allow Widgetbook Cloud to write commit statuses of your repository and add Widgetbook build links to commits.
Once you've connected your project, build linking via commit statuses is automatically enabled.

<Warning>
Commit statuses are only created for new builds after the project is connected to a Azure repository.
If you've uploaded builds before connecting the project, commit statuses are not created for these builds.
</Warning>

## How it works

Widgetbook Cloud adds a commit status to the commit of the uploaded build.
The commit status is a link to the build details page in Widgetbook Cloud and is accessed by clicking the "Widgetbook Build" commit status.
