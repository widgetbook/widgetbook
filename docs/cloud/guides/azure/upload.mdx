# Widgetbook Cloud x Azure

If you want to use Widgetbook Cloud with your existing Azure DevOps project, here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Setup Widgetbook Cloud Project">
    Create a new project in Widgetbook Cloud by importing your Azure repository.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add API Key as a Secret">
    Add `WIDGETBOOK_API_KEY` to your [Azure DevOps project's secrets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml%2Cbatch#secret-variables). You can find the API key in the Widgetbook Cloud's **project settings page**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Azure DevOps Pipeline">
    To upload a [Widgetbook Build](/cloud/builds) for each new commit in your repository, you need to setup up a workflow in Azure DevOps Pipelines that runs on every push.

    Add the following workflow to your `azure-pipeline.yaml` file.

    ```yaml
    trigger:
      branches:
        include:
          - "*"

    pr:
      branches:
        include:
          - "*"

    stages:
      - stage: WidgetbookHostingStage
        displayName: Hosting
        jobs:
          - job: HostingJob
            displayName: Hosting
            pool:
              vmImage: "ubuntu-latest"
            steps:
              - task: FlutterInstall@0
                displayName: "Install Flutter SDK"
                inputs:
                  mode: "auto"
                  channel: "stable"
                  version: "latest"

              - task: Bash@3
                displayName: "Bootstrap App"
                inputs:
                  targetType: "inline"
                  script: |
                    $(FlutterToolPath)/flutter pub get
                    # Add any other steps needed to make your
                    # app widgets available for Widgetbook

              - task: Bash@3
                displayName: "Build Widgetbook"
                inputs:
                  workingDirectory: "widgetbook"
                  targetType: "inline"
                  script: |
                    $(FlutterToolPath)/flutter pub get
                    $(DartToolPath)/dart run build_runner build -d
                    $(FlutterToolPath)/flutter build web -t lib/main.dart

              - task: Bash@3
                displayName: "Install Widgetbook CLI"
                inputs:
                  targetType: "inline"
                  script: |
                    $(DartToolPath)/dart pub global activate widgetbook_cli

              - task: Bash@3
                displayName: "Push Widgetbook Build"
                inputs:
                  workingDirectory: "widgetbook"
                  targetType: "inline"
                  script: |
                    $HOME/.pub-cache/bin/widgetbook cloud build push --api-key $(WIDGETBOOK_API_KEY)
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Pull Request">
    To test out if everything works properly, create a new branch and push a commit to it, then submit a PR with the new branch.
    After the build upload finishes, a commit status will be added to your PR once the [Widgetbook Review](/cloud/reviews) is ready.

  </Step>

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

To make sure that your Widgetbook Cloud setup works properly, you can check that your repository has a Webhook configured _(under Project Settings > Service Hooks)_ to notify Widgetbook Cloud about new PRs.
