# Access builds from Bitbucket commit statuses

Widgetbook Cloud links builds to Bitbucket commit statuses so accessing Widgetbook builds integrates seamlessly with your Bitbucket workflow.

## Prerequisites

Linking builds to Bitbucket commit statuses requires API access to your Bitbucket repository.
By [connecting a Widgetbook project to a Bitbucket repository](/cloud/projects/connect#connect-project) you allow Widgetbook Cloud to write commit statuses of your repository and add Widgetbook build links to commits.
Once you've connected your project, build linking via commit statuses is automatically enabled.

<Warning>
Commit statuses are only created for new builds after the project is connected to a Bitbucket repository.
If you've uploaded builds before connecting the project, commit statuses are not created for these builds.
</Warning>

## How it works

Widgetbook Cloud adds a commit status to the commit of the uploaded build.
The commit status is a link to the build details page in Widgetbook Cloud and is accessed by clicking the "Widgetbook Build" commit status.
