# Widgetbook Cloud x Self-hosted Bitbucket

If you want to use Widgetbook Cloud with your self-hosted Bitbucket instance (e.g. `bitbucket.acme.com`), here's a pre-requisite guide to help you get started, then you can follow our normal [Bitbucket setup guide](/cloud/guides/bitbucket/upload).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create OAuth Consumer">
    Create a new OAuth Consumer in your Bitbucket instance to authenticate your
    users with Widgetbook Cloud.

    Go to **"Workspace Settings"** > **"OAuth consumers"** > **"Add consumer"**.
    Then fill the form with the following information and click **"Save"**.

    | Field           | Value                                |
    | --------------- | ------------------------------------ |
    | Name            | Widgetbook |
    | Callback URL    | `https://clerk.widgetbook.io/v1/oauth_callback` |
    | URL             | `https://www.widgetbook.io/` |
    | Permissions (5) | `Account (Email, Read)` - `Repositories (Read)` - `Pull Requests (Read)` - `Webhooks (Read and Write)` |

  </Step>
  <Step title="Send us the Information">
    Send the following information to [engineering@widgetbook.io](mailto:engineering@widgetbook.io):

    <Warning>
      (*) Do not send the **Consumer Secret** as plain text as it is **sensitive information**.
      Instead, use a one-time shared link from your password or secret manager service (e.g. [1Password](https://support.1password.com/share-items/))
    </Warning>

    | Item                   | Reason                |

    | Company Logo (1:1 PNG) | Displayed in the user profile page for integration. |
