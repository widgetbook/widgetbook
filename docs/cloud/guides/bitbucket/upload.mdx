# Widgetbook Cloud x Bitbucket

If you want to use Widgetbook Cloud with your existing Bitbucket repository, here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Setup Widgetbook Cloud Project">
    Create a new project in Widgetbook Cloud by importing your Bitbucket repository.
    You might need to connect your Bitbucket account to Widgetbook Cloud to access your repositories.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add API Key as a Variable">
    Add `WIDGETBOOK_API_KEY` to your [Bitbucket's Pipeline Variables](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/variables-and-secrets/#User-defined-variables).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Bitbucket Pipeline">
    To upload a [Widgetbook Build](/cloud/builds) for each new commit in your repository, you need to setup up a pipeline in Bitbucket that runs on every push.

    Create a new Bitbucket pipeline file in your repository under `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` with the following content:

    ```yaml
    image: ghcr.io/cirruslabs/flutter

    pipelines:
      default:
        - step:
            name: Build Widgetbook
            script:
              # Bootstrap App
              - flutter pub get
              - flutter gen-l10n
              # Bootstrap Widgetbook
              - cd widgetbook
              - flutter pub get
              - dart run build_runner build -d
              - flutter build web
            artifacts:
              - widgetbook/build/web/**
              - widgetbook/.dart_tool/build/generated/**

        - step:
            name: Deploy Widgetbook
            script:
              - dart pub global activate widgetbook_cli
              - export PATH="$PATH":"$HOME/.pub-cache/bin"
              - cd widgetbook
              - widgetbook cloud build push --api-key "$WIDGETBOOK_API_KEY"
    ```

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create a Merge Request">
    To test out if everything works properly, create a new branch and push a commit to it, then submit a PR with the new branch.
    After the build upload finishes, a commit status will be added to your PR once the [Widgetbook Review](/cloud/reviews) is ready.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

To make sure that your Widgetbook Cloud setup works properly, you can check that your repository has a "Widgetbook Cloud" Webhook configured _(under Repository Settings > Webhooks)_ to notify Widgetbook Cloud about new PRs.
