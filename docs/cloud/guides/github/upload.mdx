# Upload builds with GitHub Actions 

If you want to use Widgetbook Cloud with your existing GitHub repository, here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Setup Widgetbook Cloud Project">
    Create a new project in Widgetbook Cloud by importing your GitHub repository.
    You might need to connect your GitHub account to Widgetbook Cloud to access your repositories.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add API Key as a Secret">
    Add `WIDGETBOOK_API_KEY` to your [GitHub repository's secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository). You can find the API key in the Widgetbook Cloud's **project settings page**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create GitHub Actions Workflow">
    To upload a [Widgetbook Build](/cloud/builds) for each new commit in your repository, you need to setup up a workflow in GitHub Actions that runs on every push.

    ```yaml
    name: Widgetbook Cloud Hosting
    on: push

    jobs:
      widgetbook-cloud-hosting:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Checkout
            uses: actions/checkout@v3

          - name: Setup flutter
            uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
            with:
                channel: stable

          - name: Bootstrap App
            run: |
                flutter pub get
                # Add any other steps needed to make your
                # app widgets available for Widgetbook

          - name: Build Widgetbook
            working-directory: widgetbook
            run: |
                flutter pub get
                dart run build_runner build -d
                flutter build web -t lib/main.dart

          - name: Install Widgetbook CLI
            run: dart pub global activate widgetbook_cli

          - name: Push Widgetbook Build
            working-directory: widgetbook
            run: widgetbook cloud build push --api-key ${{ secrets.WIDGETBOOK_API_KEY }}
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Pull Request">
    To test out if everything works properly, create a new branch and push a commit to it, then submit a PR with the new branch.
    After the build upload finishes, a commit status will be added to your PR once the [Widgetbook Review](/cloud/reviews) is ready.
  </Step>

</Steps>

## Enforcing reviews

Depending on your goals and workflow you might want to enforce reviews for all changes in your project requiring an accepted Widgetbook review for each pull requests with changes.

When Widgetbook Cloud reviews are enabled for your project, Widgetbook Cloud will automatically create a review for your PR and post the URL in your GitHub PR as a commit status. 
If changes are requested, the commit status will reflect the Widgetbook review status on your PR.
However, the default configuration in GitHub allows for PRs to be merged even if the status checks are not passing or still pending.

To enforce reviews for all changes in your project, you can set up a branch protection rule in your GitHub repository. 
This will prevent PRs from being merged until the Widgetbook review is accepted.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the rulesets settings page">
    Navigate to the repository settings in GitHub.
    In the navigation, click on *Rules* to open the accordion. 
    Then click on *Rulesets* to open the rulesets page.

    <Image src="/assets/cloud/setup/github/rulesets-page.png" />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set name">
    Make sure to set a name for the new ruleset. 
    For instance, set it to `Widgetbook Review`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Activate rulet">
    Make sure to set the enforcement status to `Active`.

    <Image src="/assets/cloud/setup/github/enable-ruleset.png" />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create new target">
    Scroll down to the *Targets* section and click on *Create target*.
    Select make sure to select the branch you want to protect.
    We recommend to choose *Include default branch* but depending on your workflow you might want to choose one or multiple branches.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Require status checks to pass">
    On the page scroll down to the rules section.
    Make sure to disable the pre-selected rules. 
    Once everything is deselected enable the rule *Require status checks to pass*. 

    <Image src="/assets/cloud/setup/github/enable-status-checks.png" />
  </Step>
    <Step title="Add Widgetbook status check">
    To make the Widgetbook Review commit status required, click the *Add checks* button.
    In the searchbox copy the name of the Widgetbook review status check which is formatted as `Widgetbook Review (<widgetbook-project-name>)`.
    If you already have a pull-request with a Widgetbook Review commit status you can also obtain the name from the status checks section in the PR.

    <Image src="/assets/cloud/setup/github/review-commit-status.png" />

    In the example above the status check is named `Widgetbook Review (widgetbook-explained)`.

    In the searchbox, select the item that is shown.
    <Image src="/assets/cloud/setup/github/create-new-check.png" />

    Once the dropdown menu is deselected, the check will be added.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a check source">
    In case no source is configured, make sure to select the *Widgetbook* app as the source.

    <Image src="/assets/cloud/setup/github/edit-check-source.png" />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create the branch ruleset">
    At the bottom of the page, make sure to press the *Create* button. 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify ruleset">
    You can navigate to a PR to verify that the Widgetbook Review status check is now required to merge the PR.
