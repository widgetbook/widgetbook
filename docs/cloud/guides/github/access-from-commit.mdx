# Access builds from GitHub commit statuses

Widgetbook Cloud links builds to [GitHub commit statuses](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/commits/statuses#about-commit-statuses) so accessing Widgetbook builds integrates seamlessly with your GitHub workflow.

## Prerequisites

Linking builds to GitHub commit statuses requires API access to your GitHub repository.
By [connecting a Widgetbook project to a GitHub repository](/cloud/projects/connect#connect-project) you allow Widgetbook Cloud to write commit statuses of your repository and add Widgetbook build links to commits.
Once you've connected your project, build linking via commit statuses is automatically enabled.

<Warning>
Commit statuses are only created for new builds after the project is connected to a GitHub repository.
If you've uploaded builds before connecting the project, commit statuses are not created for these builds.
</Warning>

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload a build">
    Upload a build as described in the [upload build guide](/cloud/guides/github/upload).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to your repository">
    While the build processes or after the build finished successfully, navigate to your GitHub repository.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Locate the commit status">
    Locate the commit status indicator for the commit.
    The commit status indicator is a green checkmark, a yellow dot, or a red cross next to the commit message.
