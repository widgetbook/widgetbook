# Widgetbook Cloud x Codemagic

Codemagic is just a CI/CD platform, which means it needs to be accompanied by a version control system (i.e. [GitHub](/cloud/setup/github), [GitLab](/cloud/setup/gitlab), [Azure](/cloud/setup/azure) or [Bitbucket](/cloud/setup/bitbucket)). In this guide, we will just be showing the workflow setup, but you need to check other version control system guides to make the [Widgetbook Cloud Reviews](/cloud/reviews) work.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add API Key as a Secret">
    Add `WIDGETBOOK_API_KEY` under `widgetbook_credentials` group in your
    [Codemagic project's environment
    variables](https://docs.codemagic.io/yaml-basic-configuration/configuring-environment-variables/#configuring-environment-variables).
    You can find the API key in the Widgetbook Cloud's **project settings page**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Setup Workflow">
    To upload a [Widgetbook Build](/cloud/builds) for each new commit in your repository, add the following workflow to your Codemagic `codemagic.yaml` file

    ```yaml
    workflows:
      widgetbook-cloud-hosting:
        name: Widgetbook Cloud Hosting

        triggering:
          events:
            - push

        environment:
          flutter: stable
          groups:
            - widgetbook_credentials

        scripts:
          - name: Bootstrap App
            script: |
              flutter pub get
              # Add any other steps needed to make your
              # app widgets available for Widgetbook

          - name: Build Widgetbook
            working_directory: widgetbook
            script: |
              flutter pub get
              dart run build_runner build -d
              flutter build web -t lib/main.dart

          - name: Install Widgetbook CLI
            script: dart pub global activate widgetbook_cli

          - name: Push Widgetbook Build
            working_directory: widgetbook
            script: widgetbook cloud build push --api-key $WIDGETBOOK_API_KEY
    ```

  </Step>
