# Widgetbook Cloud x Self-managed GitLab

If you want to use Widgetbook Cloud with your self-managed GitLab instance (e.g. `gitlab.acme.dev`), here's a pre-requisite guide to help you get started, then you can follow our normal [Gitlab setup guide](/cloud/setup/gitlab).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create OAuth Application">
    Create a new OAuth Application in your GitLab instance to authenticate your
    users with Widgetbook Cloud.

    Go to **"Group Settings"** > **"Applications"** > **"Add new application"**.
    Then fill the form with the following information and click **"Save application"**.

    | Field          | Value                                |
    | -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
    | Name           | Widgetbook                           |
    | Redirect URI   | `https://clerk.widgetbook.io/v1/oauth_callback` |
    | Confidential   | âœ…                                   |
    | Scopes         | `api` - `read_user` - `openid` - `profile` - `email` |

  </Step>
  <Step title="Send us the Information">
    Since this information contains sensitive field (like Application Secret), we recommend sending the information in the following way:

    1. Create a Google Doc filled with the items below.
    2. Share the document with [engineering@widgetbook.io](mailto:engineering@widgetbook.io) via email.
    3. Once your information is processed, you can safely delete the document.

    | Item                   | Reason                |
    | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
    | Company Name (e.g. Acme) | Displayed in the user profile page for integration. |
    | Company Logo (1:1 PNG) | Displayed in the user profile page for integration. |
    | Company Email Domain (e.g. acme.com) | Users who have a Widgetbook Cloud account with an email having this domain, will be able to see the integration is the user profile page. |
    | Company GitLab Domain (e.g. gitlab.acme.com) | To send GitLab API requests to. |
    | Application (from previous step) | For OAuth Integration |
    | Application Secret (from previous step) | For OAuth Integration |

  </Step>
</Steps>
