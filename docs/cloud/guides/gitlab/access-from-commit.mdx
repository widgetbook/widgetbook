# Access builds from GitLab commit statuses

Widgetbook Cloud links builds to [GitLab commit statuses](https://docs.gitlab.com/api/commits/#commit-status) so accessing Widgetbook builds integrates seamingless with your GitLab workflow.

## Prerequisites

Linking builds to GitLab commit statuses requires API access to your GitLab repository.
By [connecting a Widgetbook project to a GitLab repository](/cloud/projects/connect#connect-project) you allow Widgetbook Cloud to write commit statuses of your repository and add Widgetbook build links to commits.
Once you've connected your project, build linking via commit statuses is automatically enabled.

<Warning>
Commit statuses are only created for new builds after the project is connected to a GitLab repository.
If you've uploaded builds before connecting the project, commit statuses are not created for these builds.
</Warning>

## How it works

Widgetbook Cloud adds a commit status to the commit of the uploaded build.
The commit status is a link to the build details page in Widgetbook Cloud and is accessed by clicking the "Widgetbook Build" stage in the GitLab pipelines view.
