# Security Overview

At Widgetbook, security and privacy are at the core of our platform. We are committed to safeguarding your data while ensuring a seamless experience for developing and cataloging your Flutter components.

## Data Handling and Privacy

### Mocked Data Usage

We strongly encourage developers to use [mocked data](/guides/mocking) instead of real user data when using Widgetbook. This ensures that **no sensitive or personal information is stored or displayed** in Widgetbook or Widgetbook Cloud, including builds, reviews, and snapshots.

### Source Code Protection

Widgetbook Cloud **does not store source code**. Builds are compiled on your local machine or CI/CD and uploaded as a **binary artifact** to our servers, ensuring that the original source code remains under your full control. 

We store only minimal Git metadata necessary for collaboration and traceability:
- Git commit hash and message
- Git branch name
- Git pull request title and number

### Data Retention Policies

- Builds, Reviews, and Use-Cases are retained for **90 days** and automatically deleted afterward.
- Security logs, including audit and access logs, are retained for **up to one year** for internal security monitoring.

## GDPR Compliance

Widgetbook and Widgetbook Cloud are fully **GDPR-compliant**. We ensure:
- Transparent and lawful processing of personal data.
- Mechanisms for users to access, rectify, and delete their data.
- Adherence to data minimization principles by storing only necessary information.

For further details, refer to our [Privacy Policy](https://www.widgetbook.io/privacy-policy).

## Secure Cloud Infrastructure  

Widgetbook’s infrastructure is hosted within **AWS’s secure data centers**, ensuring high availability, robust security, and compliance with industry standards. 
AWS continuously assesses risks, implements stringent security measures, and undergoes regular audits to maintain the highest security standards. 
For more details, refer to [AWS Compliance Programs](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/).

Our reliance on **AWS’s globally distributed infrastructure** allows us to deliver a **resilient, high-performance platform**, with built-in redundancy and failover mechanisms to safeguard your data. 
Additionally, AWS data centers are designed to meet **strict regulatory and security requirements**, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your data at all times.

## Security Measures

### Encryption

We use industry-standard encryption to protect data at all stages:

- **Data in Transit**: All communication between your devices and Widgetbook servers is secured using **TLS 1.2/1.3** encryption.
- **Data at Rest**: Sensitive data is encrypted using **AES-256** and other industry best practices provided by our cloud providers.

### Access Controls

To prevent unauthorized access, Widgetbook enforces strict access control mechanisms:

- **Authentication**: Secure authentication via OAuth and third-party identity providers.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Permissions are assigned based on roles (e.g., administrator, member) to ensure least-privilege access.

## Third-Party Risk Management

Widgetbook relies on trusted cloud service providers:
- **AWS** for hosting and infrastructure security (see [AWS Security](https://aws.amazon.com/security/)).
- **Neon** for database management (see [Neon Security](https://neon.tech/docs/security/security-overview)).
- **Clerk** for authentication services (see [Clerk Security](https://clerk.com/docs/security/overview)).

We conduct **regular risk assessments** to ensure these providers maintain compliance with security best practices.

## User Responsibilities

While we ensure a **secure infrastructure**, we encourage users to follow best security practices:
- **Use strong, unique passwords** and protect access credentials.
- **Avoid uploading sensitive data** unless necessary.
- **Review permissions** regularly to maintain proper access control.
