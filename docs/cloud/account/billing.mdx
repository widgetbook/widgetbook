# Billing

Widgetbook Cloud subscriptions are billed monthly. Your billing cycle begins on the calendar day your subscription starts and renews on the same day each subsequent month.
For example, if you start on June 5, the first cycle runs from June 5 to July 5 and renews on July 5.

Any usage beyond your plan's included quota is billed as overage within the same billing period according to your plan's rates.

## Enterprise billing options

Annual and invoice-based billing are available only for enterprise customers. 
If you are interested in these options, please contact us at [contact@widgetbook.io](mailto:contact@widgetbook.io).

## How we count snapshots

Snapshot usage is measured at the workspace level. 
A workspace can contain multiple projects, and usage is the sum of all snapshots taken across all projects within the workspace. 
We do not show usage on a per-project basis.

## View your snapshot usage

You can view your current plan and usage at any time:

1. Open your workspace in Widgetbook Cloud.
2. Go to `Settings`.
3. Click `Billing`.

The Usage section shows your snapshot consumption and build count. 
The snapshot bar indicates how many snapshots you have used relative to your quota.
