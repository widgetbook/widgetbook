# Overview

With _Widgetbook Builds_ developers can host a Widgetbook for each Git commit and make the specific Widgetbook easily accessible for the whole team on Widgetbook Cloud.
When setup with CI/CD, you consistantly upload builds for each commit, pull-request and branch and make those builds accessible from your favorite Git provider.

## Versioning Widgetbook

Making adjustments to your Flutter frontend code means creating new versions of:
- your components  
- your app  
- your Widgetbook  
These updates are made by submitting new commits.

Developers often need to share specific versions with their team â€” including developers, designers, QA testers, and product managers.

Widgetbook Cloud supports **versioning with builds** by:
- Uploading the Widgetbook build for every commit  
- Hosting builds for each branch

## Status

Widgetbook Cloud expects that builds are immutable, therefore only one build with a specific commit SHA can exist for each project.
In the lifecycle of a build, a build transitions through the following statuses:
- **Draft:** The upload of a new build has been requested and is in the process of uploading.
- **In progress:** The build uploaded and we're processing the snapshots.
- **Successful:** The build successfully uploaded and all snapshots are processed.
- **Failed:** The build failed to upload or process snapshots.
