# Access build from Git commit

Since you manage your code with a Git provider, Widgetbook Cloud aims to seamlessly **integrate with your Git provider** to make Widgetbook builds accessible to your team.
Therefore, **Widgetbook Cloud links builds to commit statuses** of your Git provider.

As Git provider implementations differ, find descriptions for your provider below.
