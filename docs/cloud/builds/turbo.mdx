# Turbo Builds âš¡

Turbo Builds is a feature that can **save you a lot of time** when pushing builds to Widgetbook Cloud. It works by creating a unique hash for each build depending on it's contents. So if you changed build-irrelevant files (e.g. test files, README, CI/CD configs, etc.) the build will be **instantly** available in Widgetbook Cloud without having to wait for the build to process.

## Caveats

Turbo Builds might misbehave in some cases like:

1. If you use external URLs (e.g. image sources) in your build, and the content of those URLs change but the URL remains the same.
1. You use any network requests that might change the use-case behavior.

## Disable Turbo Builds

If you would like to disable Turbo Builds, you can do so by specifying the `--no-turbo` flag when running the `widgetbook cloud build push` command:

```bash
widgetbook cloud build push --no-turbo --api-key <API_KEY>
```
