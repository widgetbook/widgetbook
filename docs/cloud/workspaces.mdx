# Workspaces

The first step in getting started with Widgetbook Cloud is setting up a workspace for your team.

## Overview

A workspace serves as the central hub for all your projects and allows you to manage the team members that have access to the builds, pull requests, and reviews within the workspace. 
We recommend keeping all organizational efforts within a single workspace, as this aligns with how the product is designed conceptually.

## Workspace settings

<Warning>Only an owner of a workspace can access workspace settings.</Warning>

Navigate to the settings by selecting the workspace and clicking `Settings`. You can access the following setting categories and operations:

General
- Change the workspace name
- Delete the workspace

Members
- Add or remove members to the workspace
- Change the role of a member

Billing
- See and manage your current plan
- Investigate your usage

### Delete workspace

Deleting a workspace includes deleting build, pull request, and review data. 
The owner can delete the workspace under `Settings > General > Delete workspace`.
This action is not reversible.

## Multiple workspaces

You have the option to create several workspaces under a single Widgetbook account (e.g., associated with the same email). 
For those using Widgetbook Cloud for both work and personal projects, we suggest creating separate Widgetbook Cloud accounts, each linked to a different email address.

To add a workspace to your account:
1. Click on the workspace selector in the top left corner.
2. Click on "Create workspace".
3. You will be asked to provide a workspace name.
