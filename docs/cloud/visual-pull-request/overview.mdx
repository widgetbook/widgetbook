# Visual Pull Requests

Unlike code-based pull requests, visual pull requests focus on visual changes in a project. 
They allow developers to review and discuss user interface changes, ensuring the application's visual aspects meet the desired standards.

## Review Challenges 

Developers often encounter the following challenges when reviewing visual changes:
- Traditional code-based pull requests do not provide a clear view of visual changes, making it difficult to assess their impact and increasing the risk of unwanted regressions.
- Teams struggle to communicate effectively about visual changes, leading to misunderstandings and misalignment.
- Providing stakeholders with an application to review visual changes is cumbersome and time-consuming.

## Solving the Problem

Widgetbook Cloud addresses these challenges by providing a dedicated platform for visual pull requests. Key features include:

- **Visual Diffing**: Automatically generates visual diffs for changes, making it easy to see the impact of code changes on the user interface.
- **Collaborative Review**: Facilitates discussions around visual changes, allowing team members to provide feedback directly on the visual representation.
- **Stakeholder Access**: Offers a user-friendly interface for stakeholders to review visual changes without complex setup.

By streamlining the process of reviewing visual changes, Widgetbook Cloud helps teams ship faster without UI regressions.

## Code vs. Visual Pull Requests

In a code-based pull request, teams look for bugs, performance issues, and code quality. 
In a visual pull request, teams look for visual differences between the design and the implementation, and work to prevent regressions between versions. 
Both types of reviews are important to ensure the code is correct and the design is implemented as expected.
