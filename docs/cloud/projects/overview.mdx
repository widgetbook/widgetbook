# Projects

Projects are the central hub for your Widgetbook builds, pull requests, and reviews.

## Overview

A workspace is organized into different projects. 
It's up to you how you choose to divide your projects.

Consider grouping projects by:
- Design systems (Flutter packages)
- Applications (Flutter apps)
- Repositories

<Info>
If you're unsure how to divide your repository into Widgetbook projects, start with a single project. 
It's easy to add and migrate to a more refined project structure later.

## Your projects

Your projects are displayed on the [workspace dashboard](https://app.widgetbook.io).

Each project includes the following tabs to help organize your data in Widgetbook Cloud:

- **[Builds](/cloud/builds/overview)**: A list of builds, each representing a commit of a Widgetbook version.
- **[Pull requests](/cloud/reviews)**: A list of synchronized pull requests from your Git repository, reflecting UI changes.
- **Settings**: Access and manage project configurations.

## Project settings

<Warning>Only workspace owners can access project settings.</Warning>

To access the settings, select a project within the current workspace and click `Settings`. 
The following settings categories and operations are available:

General
- Change the project name
- Fetch and regenerate the API key
- Specify the project's default branch
- Delete the project

Git
- Manage the connection to your Git repository

### Delete workspace

Deleting a project removes build, pull request, and review data. 
The owner can delete the project under `Settings > General > Delete project`.
This action is not reversible.

## FAQ

<Accordion title="How can I make my workspace or project public?">
As of now, it is not possible to make a workspace or project public. However, we are planning to add this feature soon.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="I do not see my repository. What can I do?">
If you do not see your repository in the list of available repositories, ensure the following:
1. Your user has the necessary permissions to access the repository. 
1. If you're using GitHub, make sure you have granted the GitHub app the necessary permissions to access your repositories. For more information, refer to the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/using-github-apps/reviewing-and-modifying-installed-github-apps#modifying-repository-access).
1. Due to technical reasons, Widgetbook Cloud only shows the 5 most recently accessed repositories. If you want to connect a repository that is not listed, you can use the search input box to filter the shown repositories. Make sure the repository is properly spelled. The search is case-sensitive!
