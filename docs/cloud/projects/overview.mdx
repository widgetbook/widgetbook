# Projects

Projects are the central hub for your Widgetbook builds, pull requests, and reviews.

## Overview

A workspace is organized into different projects. 
It's up to you how you choose to divide your projects.

Consider grouping projects by:
- Design systems (Flutter packages)
- Applications (Flutter apps)
- Repositories

<Info>
If you're unsure how to divide your repository into Widgetbook projects, start with a single project. 
It's easy to add and migrate to a more refined project structure later.

## Your projects

Your projects are displayed on the [workspace dashboard](https://app.widgetbook.io).

Each project includes the following tabs to help organize your data in Widgetbook Cloud:

- **[Builds](/cloud/builds/overview)**: A list of builds, each representing a commit of a Widgetbook version.
- **[Pull requests](/cloud/reviews)**: A list of synchronized pull requests from your Git repository, reflecting UI changes.
- **Settings**: Access and manage project configurations.

## Project settings

<Warning>Only workspace owners can access project settings.</Warning>

To access the settings, select a project within the current workspace and click `Settings`. 
The following settings categories and operations are available:

General
- Change the project name
- Fetch and regenerate the API key
- Specify the project's default branch
- Delete the project

- Manage the connection to your Git repository

### Delete workspace

Deleting a project removes build, pull request, and review data. 
The owner can delete the project under `Settings > General > Delete project`.
This action is not reversible.
