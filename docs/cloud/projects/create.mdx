# Create project

To create a new project, click the `Create project` button on the workspace page. 
You will be prompted to create a project from a Git repository. 
Alternatively, you can [create a project manually](/cloud/projects/create#create-project-manually).

## Create project from Git repository

<Warning>
  The user creating the project must have **admin rights** to the git repository
  (i.e. has access to repository settings).
</Warning>

Creating a project from a Git repository is the most common and recommended method. 
A connected project automatically synchronizes builds with their commit status and links reviews with their associated pull requests, enhancing Widgetbook Cloud's integration into your workflow.

We support the following Git providers:
- GitHub
- GitLab
- Bitbucket
- Azure

To create a project from a Git repository, connect your Git provider account and select the repository you'd like to use for the project. 

The project name is automatically set based on the repository name. 
For example, if your repository is called `acme-app`, the project will also be named `acme-app`. 
You can rename the project in the settings without affecting project synchronization.

<Info>If the repository does not show up, use the search input box to filter the shown repositories.</Info>

### Monorepo

If you want to create multiple projects (e.g., for a design system and several apps) from a monorepo, ensure that all projects are created from the same repository. 
Widgetbook Cloud supports mapping multiple projects to a single repository.

## Create project manually

<Warning>
Manually created projects do not support pull request synchronization and Widgetbook Cloud reviews — a feature highly appreciated by our customers.
</Warning>

If you're unable to connect your Git repository (e.g., due to permission issues or other reasons), creating a project manually is a good alternative to get started. 
You can always [connect your project to a repository](/cloud/projects/connect#connect-project) later on.

To create a project manually, click the `Create a new project yourself` link above the Git provider selector and enter the project name.
