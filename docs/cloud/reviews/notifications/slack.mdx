# Slack Notifications

Widgetbook Cloud integrates with Slack to keep your team informed about visual pull requests that need review. 
Notifications are sent automatically to your Slack workspace, ensuring that reviews don't go unnoticed.

## What you'll receive

Slack notifications are sent when a visual pull request requires review. Each notification includes:

- Pull request number and title
- Direct link to view changes in Widgetbook Cloud
- Workspace and project name

Notifications appear as Slack messages with a yellow accent to draw attention.

<Info>
  Notifications are only sent for pull requests with "pending review" status. 
  Approved pull requests or those with "changes requested" do not trigger notifications.

## Setup Slack integration

## Configuration scope

The Slack integration is configured at the workspace level:

- Set it up once per Widgetbook workspace
- All projects within the workspace send notifications to the configured Slack channel
- No per-project configuration needed

## Manage notifications

To stop receiving Slack notifications, go to your workspace General Settings and disconnect the Slack integration. This will disable all notifications for that workspace.
