# Email Notifications

Widgetbook Cloud sends email notifications to keep reviewers informed about pull request assignments and review status changes.

## What you'll receive

Email notifications are sent in two events:

### Reviewer assignment

When a user is assigned as a reviewer to a pull request, they receive an email immediately with:

- Pull request title
- Direct link to view the pull request in Widgetbook Cloud

This email is always sent when reviewers are assigned.

### Review status updates

When a pull request's review status changes, all assigned reviewers receive an email with:

- Project name
- Pull request title
- Current review status (pending, approved, or changes requested)
- Direct link to view the pull request

<Info>
  For "Pending" status: If reviewers have already been notified and no new reviews have been submitted, duplicate notifications won't be sent to avoid email spam.
</Info>
