Widgetbook Cloud Reviews not just helps you introduce **UI Reviews** in your workflow, but also helps you to **detect UI regressions automatically** with a zero-configuration setup _(i.e. without writing any golden tests)_. It provides a structured review process to ensure that all **UI changes are intentional** and match the design expectations.

## Code Review vs UI Review

In a code review, you are looking for bugs, performance issues, and code quality. In a UI review, you are looking for visual differences between the design and the implementation. It is important to have both types of reviews to ensure that the code is correct and the design is implemented as expected.

| **Purpose**    | To find bugs, performance issues, and code quality | To find visual differences between the design and the implementation     |
| **Comparison** | **Code changes** between `base` and `head` commits | **Visual differences** between `base` and `head` [builds](/cloud/builds) |
| **Tool**       | Version Control Systems (e.g. GitHub, GitLab)      | Widgetbook Cloud                                                         |

## UI Review Workflow

<Info>
  **Prerequisite:** Make sure you have finished the setup of Widgetbook Cloud
  for [GitHub](/cloud/setup/github), [GitLab](/cloud/setup/gitlab) or [Azure
  DevOps](/cloud/setup/azure-devops).
</Info>

1. Submit a PR with your changes using your version control system (e.g. GitHub, GitLab).
1. Widgetbook Cloud will **automatically** create a review for your PR and post the URL in your git PR as a **commit status**.
1. Reviewers should review the visual differences _(if any)_, and either **approve** the changes or **request changes**.
1. The review status will be **reflected** in the commit status of your git PR.
1. If changes are requested, the commit status will **block your PR from getting merged** until the requested changes are applied. _(you can disable this behavior from your project settings)_

## Empower UI Reviews

To give the reviewer more power, you can use the following features:

1. [**Figma Reviews**](/cloud/reviews/figma): Compare the implementation with the Figma design.
1. [**Multi Snapshot Reviews**](/cloud/reviews/multi-snapshot): Generate snapshots for each use-case in multiple configurations (i.e. themes, locales, devices, etc.); to ensure that the UI is consistent across all configurations.

## Limitations

### Animations

If your use-cases have any animations (e.g. `CircularProgressIndication`), then the visual comparison might not work as expected. This is because the visual comparison algorithm is not able to compare animations.

We suggest using one of the following workarounds:

1. **Adaptive animations**: you might want to still enjoy your animations while running Widgetbook, but you just need to disable them when the use-case is being used in a Widgetbook-Cloud-context. To do so, you can use the following `extension`, to make your use-cases adaptive to the Widgetbook Cloud Reviews and disable the animations during the visual comparison.

   ```dart
   extension WidgetbookContext on BuildContext {
     /// The `preview` query parameter is used while taking snapshots of the
     /// use-case for Widgetbook Cloud Reviews. This getter can be used to
     /// customize the behavior of the use-case while taking the snapshots,
     /// it can be used to disable animations for example.
     bool get isInWidgetbookCloud => WidgetbookState.of(this).previewMode;
   }

   @UseCase(name: 'Default', type: CircularProgressIndicator)
   Widget adaptiveAnimationUseCase(BuildContext context) {
     return CircularProgressIndicator(
       value: context.isInWidgetbookCloud ? 0.5 : null,
     );
   }
   ```

1. **Starting animations on-demand**: you can use a `boolean` knob to start your animations. This way, you can disable the animations during the visual comparison but you can still see the animations in the Widgetbook.

   ```dart
   @UseCase(name: 'Default', type: CircularProgressIndicator)
   Widget onDemandAnimationUseCase(BuildContext context) {
     return CircularProgressIndicator(
       value: context.knobs.boolean(label: 'Static') ? 0.5 : null,
     );
   }
   ```

### Random values

If your use-case displays random values (e.g. dates), that can be different across different builds, the visual comparison might not work as expected.

We suggest using one of the following workarounds:

1. Use a **constant value** for the random value.

   ```dart
   @UseCase(name: 'Default', type: Text)
   Widget constantValueUseCase(BuildContext context) {
     return Text(Random().nextInt(10).toString()); // [!code --]
     return Text('10'); // [!code ++]
   }
   ```

1. Use [**Knobs**](/knobs) with a default value.

   ```dart
   @UseCase(name: 'Default', type: Text)
   Widget constantValueUseCase(BuildContext context) {
     return Text(Random().nextInt(10).toString()); // [!code --]
     return Text( // [!code ++]
       context.knobs.string(label: 'value', defaultValue: '10'), // [!code ++]
     ); // [!code ++]
   }
   ```
