Widgetbook Cloud Reviews not only help you introduce **UI Reviews** into your workflow, but also enable you to **automatically detect UI regressions** with zero configuration (i.e., without writing any golden tests). It provides a structured review process to ensure that all **UI changes are intentional** and match design expectations.

## Code Review vs. UI Review

In a code review, you look for bugs, performance issues, and code quality. 
In a UI review, you look for visual differences between the design and the implementation. 
Both types of reviews are important to ensure the code is correct and the design is implemented as expected.

## UI Review Workflow

<Info>
**Prerequisite:** Make sure you have completed the setup of Widgetbook Cloud for 
[GitHub](/cloud/guides/github/upload),
[GitLab](/cloud/guides/gitlab/upload), 
[Azure DevOps](cloud/guides/azure/upload), or
[Bitbucket](cloud/guides/bitbucket/upload).
</Info>

1. Submit a pull request (PR) with your changes using your version control system (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
1. Widgetbook Cloud will **automatically** create a review for your PR and post the URL in your git PR as a **commit status**.
1. Reviewers should review the visual differences (if any) and either **approve** the changes or **request changes**.
1. The review status will be **reflected** in the commit status of your git PR.
1. If changes are requested, the commit status will **block your PR from being merged** until the requested changes are applied. (You can disable this behavior in your project settings.)

## Empower UI Reviews

To give reviewers more power, you can use the following features:

1. [**Figma Reviews**](/cloud/reviews/figma): Compare the implementation with the Figma design.
1. [**Multi Snapshot Reviews**](/cloud/snapshots/multi-snapshot): Generate snapshots for each use case in multiple configurations (e.g., themes, locales, devices) to ensure UI consistency across all configurations.
