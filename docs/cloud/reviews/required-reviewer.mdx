# Required reviewers 

<Warning>
  This feature is currently in **beta**.
  Please report any issues you encounter and provide feedback regarding improvements.
</Warning>

Due to the hierarchical nature of some teams, Widgetbook Cloud allows you to designate certain reviewers as required for visual pull requests. 
Therefore, this feature is great to ensure that specific team members, such as leads or designers, review and approve changes before they are merged.

When one or multiple required reviewers are defined, the approval of **at least one** of them is mandatory before the visual pull request is considered approved and can be merged.

## Enable required reviewers

<Info>
  Only workspace owners can access the Settings tab and configure required reviewers.

## Pull request approval with required reviewers

When required reviewers are configured for a project, the approval status of a visual pull request is determined by the combination of reviews from both required and non-required reviewers.

### Review status logic

The visual pull request will be marked as **Approved** only when **both** of the following conditions are met:

1. At least one required reviewer has approved the visual pull request
2. No reviewer (required or non-required) has requested changes

This means that:

- Approvals from non-required reviewers alone are not sufficient to approve the pull request. At least one required reviewer must approve.
- A single "Request changes" review blocks approval, regardless of whether it comes from a required or non-required reviewer.
- Multiple required reviewers can be configured, but only one of them needs to approve (unless someone requests changes).
