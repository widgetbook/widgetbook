# Component
When you're asked to create a component you must
- Call the get_code and get_variable_defs tools from the Figma MCP to obtain general information about the component
- Implement the component for the app 
- Implement Widgetbook use cases accordingly
- Navigate to the Widgetbook use case 
- Take a screenshot from the Widgetbook use case using the Widgetbook MCP
- Obtain the image of the Figma component using the Figma MCP
- Compare the screenshot from Widgetbook with the image from Figma and improve the implementation until both the image show visually the same component. The two images do not need match pixel perfectly. 

## Using Widgetbook
- Expect that the build_runner for Widgetbook uses the watch command and therefore, Widgetbook is always updated after a use case has been added in code
- Expect that the Widgetbook is already running in Debug mode and the new use case is already available within it
- Use the Widgetbook MCP and its tool to operate Widgetbook
