# Semantics Addon

<Warning>
  This addon is currently **experimental**, so any breaking changes can be
  introduced at any minor version.
</Warning>

The Semantics Addon is a powerful tool that allows you to visualize the semantics tree of your widget. This is particularly useful for debugging accessibility issues and ensuring that your app is accessible to all users.

The addon is based on a minimal variant of Flutter's [`SemanticsDebugger`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/SemanticsDebugger-class.html) widget.

## Usage

```dart title=widgetbook/lib/widgetbook.config.dart
final config = Config)
  // ...
  addons: [
    SemanticsAddon(), // [!code highlight]
  ],
);
```

## Order

Since the [order of addons](/addons/overview#order-of-addons) matters, the `SemanticsAddon` should be used **after all other addons**, as they might be adding some semantics nodes to the tree.

## Mode

To use this addon for [testing](/testing), you can enable the `SemanticsMode` in your stories:

```dart
final $Default = _Story(
  scenarios: [
    _Scenario(
      name: 'Semantics',
      modes: [
        SemanticsMode(true), // [!code highlight]
      ]
    ),
  ],
)
```
