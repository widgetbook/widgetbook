# Text Scale Add-on

The Text Scale Add-on is a Widgetbook utility designed for modifying the active text scale
factor using MediaQuery. This enables users to manipulate the
MediaQueryData.textScaleFactor value and observe its impact on rendering use-cases.
Visualizing changes in text scale can prove valuable for developers, as it allows them to
understand how layout adjustments correspond to variations in text scale and,
consequently, text size.

Here's how the UI would vary with text scales of 1.00 and 1.25:

|                              Texts scale of 1.00                               |                                Text scale of 1.25                                 |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| <Image zoom src="/assets/addons/text-scales/text-scale-1.png" height="650" /> | <Image zoom src="/assets/addons/text-scales/text-scale-1.25.png" height="650" /> |

## Setup

The `TextScaleAddon` invocation declares an instance of the Text Scale Add-on for
Widgetbook.

```dart
TextScaleAddon(
  scales: [1.0, 2.0],
  initialScale: 1,
)
```

This instance is defined with two attributes: `scales` and `initialScale`. The scales
attribute takes a list of double values representing the available text scales that users
can select. In this example, users can choose between a standard scale (1.0) and a larger
scale (2.0) when previewing widgets. The `initialScale` attribute specifies the default or
active text scale when the application is first run. In this case, the application will
start with a standard text scale of 1.0.

To understand this better, let's look at an example.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:widgetbook/widgetbook.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const WidgetbookApp());
}

class WidgetbookApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const WidgetbookApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Widgetbook.material(
      directories: [],
      addons: [
        TextScaleAddon(
          scales: [1.0, 2.0],
          initialScale: 1,
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

This Text Scale Add-on allows users to switch between a regular scale of 1.0 and a larger
scale of 2.0, enabling them to investigate how these different scales affect the
appearance and layout of the widgets in the application. By offering a way to experiment
with different scales, the Text Scale Add-on contributes to creating more accessible and
adaptive user interfaces.
