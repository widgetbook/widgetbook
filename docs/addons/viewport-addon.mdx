# Viewport Addon

<Warning>
  This addon is currently experimental, and it will replace the [Device Frame
  Addon](/addons/device-frame-addon) in the future.
</Warning>

The Viewport Addon is an invaluable tool that lets you preview your use-cases on various viewports. These viewports simulate a realistic environment by:

1. Setting width and height boundaries to your use-case.
1. Overriding `MediaQuery`'s `devicePixelRatio` to ensure your component behaves as as expected on different devices.
1. Overriding `ThemeData.platform` to simulate different platforms.

If you are using [Widgetbook Cloud](/cloud), unlike the [Device Frame Addon](/addons/device-frame-addon), the Viewport Addon works with [**Multi Snapshot Reviews**](/cloud/reviews/multi-snapshot).

## Setup

Here's how to configure it:

```dart
ViewportAddon(Viewports.all),
```
