# Device Frame Add-on

The Device Frame Add-on is an invaluable tool that lets you preview your use-cases on
various device frames. These frames provide a realistic environment by introducing
constraints for width and height, resembling actual devices. They override `MediaQuery`
parameters to ensure your component behaves as expected across different devices.

| DefaultDeviceFrame | ✅          | A frame based on the [device_frame package](https://pub.dev/packages/device_frame) |
| WidgetbookFrame    | ✅          | A minimal, borderless frame                                                        |
| NoFrame            | ➖          | A device-less frame that resized whenever the Widgetbook window is changed         |

## Setup

Setting up the Device Frame Add-on in your Widgetbook is straightforward. Let's walk
through the steps:

### Step 1:

The first step is identifying which devices you want to preview your components. You can
select from a predefined list of devices. Here's an example with a selection of iPhone
models:

```dart
devices: [
    Devices.ios.iPhoneSE,
    Devices.ios.iPhone13,
],
```

### Step 2 (Optional):

As an optional step, you can define a default device to be displayed when the Widgetbook
app launches. If you do not specify an `initialDevice`, the first device in your list is
selected by default. In this example, we're setting the iPhone 13 as the default device:

```dart
initialDevice: Devices.ios.iPhone13,
```

### Step 3:

Construct the Device Frame Add-on with your devices and `initialDevice` defined, you can
now create the Device Frame Add-on using the DeviceFrameAddon class. This class takes in
your device list and, optionally, the initialDevice:

This setup will launch your Widgetbook app with the iPhone 13 screen constraints by
default, enabling you to swiftly check your widgets' responsiveness and visual consistency
on this device. You can then quickly switch to the other defined devices to compare
results. Please note that the actual appearance of the preview may vary depending on the
specific features and constraints of the chosen device models.

```dart
DeviceFrameAddon(
    devices: [
        Devices.ios.iPhoneSE,
        Devices.ios.iPhone13,
    ],
    initialDevice: Devices.ios.iPhone13,
),
```

## Custom devices

You can define your own custom device by using the `Device` class:

```dart
Device(
  name: 'Custom Device',
  resolution: Resolution.dimensions(
    width: 500,
    height: 500,
    scaleFactor: 2,
  ),
  type: DeviceType.tablet,
),
```
