# Use-cases

A Use-case is a specific state or variant of a design component _(or a Flutter widget)_. It is a way to showcase a component in different scenarios.

## Use-cases for Components

Your design system will usually have multiple components, and each component will have multiple use-cases. For example, a button component might have use-cases for different states like `Primary`, `Secondary`, `Disabled` etc.

```dart title="components/lib/button.dart"
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

enum ButtonState {
  primary,
  secondary,
  disabled,
}

class Button extends StatelessWidget {
  final String text;
  final ButtonState state;

  const Button({
    super.key,
    required this.text,
    required this.state,
  });

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Implementation of the button based on state
  }
}
```

```dart title="widgetbook/lib/button.dart"
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:widgetbook_annotation/widgetbook_annotation.dart';

import 'package:components/button.dart';

@UseCase(name: 'Primary', type: Button)
Widget primaryButton(BuildContext context) {
  return Button(
    text: 'Primary',
    state: ButtonState.primary,
  );
}

@UseCase(name: 'Secondary', type: Button)
Widget secondaryButton(BuildContext context) {
  return Button(
    text: 'Secondary',
    state: ButtonState.secondary,
  );
}

@UseCase(name: 'Disabled', type: Button)
Widget disabledButton(BuildContext context) {
  return Button(
    text: 'Disabled',
    state: ButtonState.disabled,
  );
}
```

<Info>
  In the previous code, instead of passing `text` as a constant value, you can
  use a [knob](/knobs/overview) to change the text value in the Widgetbook UI, and see
  how your button behaves with extra-long text, or with an empty text.

## Use-cases for Screens

A screen is a composition of multiple components but as you move up the component hierarchy toward the screen level, you deal with more complexity. That's why it is **recommended** to catalog your screens in Widgetbook to be able to test them in isolation.

There are two common patterns for building screens:

1. **Pure Screens**: Screens that are fully presentational and don't depend on external data or services. You can create a use-case for them like any other component.
2. **Contained Screens**: Screens that depend on external data or services. Check out our [mocking guide](/guides/mocking) to know how to handle such screens.
