# Quick Start

## Bootstrap

<Info>
  If you are using Widgetbook in a monorepo, check the
  [Monorepo](/guides/monorepo) guide.
</Info>

The first step to start using Widgetbook is to create a new separate Flutter app for your widget catalog.

1. Create a new Flutter project inside your app's directory:

   ```bash
   ## All platforms
   flutter create widgetbook --empty

   ## Certain platforms
   flutter create widgetbook --empty --platforms=web,macos
   ```

1. To avoid naming conflict with the [Widgetbook pub package](https://pub.dev/packages/widgetbook), change the project `name` to `widgetbook_workspace` inside the `widgetbook/pubspec.yaml` file:

   ```diff
   - name: widgetbook
   + name: widgetbook_workspace
   ```

1. Add the following dependencies to your `widgetbook` project:

   ```bash
   flutter pub add widgetbook widgetbook_annotation dev:widgetbook_generator dev:build_runner
   ```

1. Add your app as a path dependency to the `widgetbook/pubspec.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     your_app:
       path: ../
   ```

After finishing the setup, the folder structure should look something like this:

```tree
your_app/
├── pubspec.yaml
├── lib/
├── ...
└── widgetbook/
    ├── pubspec.yaml
    ├── lib/
    └── ...
```

And the `widgetbook/pubspec.yaml` file should look like this:

```yaml
name: widgetbook_workspace
# ...

dependencies:
  widgetbook_annotation: ^{{ versions.annotation }}
  widgetbook: ^{{ versions.widgetbook }}
  your_app:
    path: ../

dev_dependencies:
  build_runner:
  widgetbook_generator: ^{{ versions.generator }}
```

## Your First Use-case

In this section, you will create a simple use-case and show it inside your Widgetbook app.

1. Choose a widget from `your_app` that you want to catalog. **For this example, we will use the imaginary `CoolButton` widget**.

1. Create a file inside your `widgetbook` app at `widgetbook/lib/cool_button.dart`

   <Info>
     If your widget needs some parameters, you can pass some constants for now
     for simplicity. Later you can check how to use [Knobs](/knobs/overview).
   </Info>

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
   import 'package:widgetbook_annotation/widgetbook_annotation.dart' as widgetbook;

   // Import the widget from your app
   import 'package:your_app/cool_button.dart';

   @widgetbook.UseCase(name: 'Default', type: CoolButton)
   Widget buildCoolButtonUseCase(BuildContext context) {
     return CoolButton();
   }
   ```

1. Create a file inside your `widgetbook` app at `lib/main.dart`

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
   import 'package:widgetbook/widgetbook.dart';
   import 'package:widgetbook_annotation/widgetbook_annotation.dart' as widgetbook;

   // This file does not exist yet,
   // it will be generated in the next step
   import 'main.directories.g.dart';

   void main() {
     runApp(const WidgetbookApp());
   }

   @widgetbook.App()
   class WidgetbookApp extends StatelessWidget {
     const WidgetbookApp({super.key});

     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Widgetbook.material(
         // The [directories] variable does not exist yet,
         // it will be generated in the next step
         directories: directories,
       );
     }
   }
   ```

1. Run the following command to generate the `main.directories.g.dart` file that has the `directories` variable:

   ```bash
   dart run build_runner build -d
   ```

1. Now you can run your Widgetbook app and see your use-case in action:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

1. Add some [Addons](/addons) to your Widgetbook app to customize the appearance of your use-case.

## Migrating Existing Widgets

If you already have a number of widgets developed in your design system, it may be time consuming to create use-cases for all of them manually.

Our friends at LeanCode developed a VS Code extension - [Widgetbook Entries Generator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LeanCode.widgetbook-generator) - to help with the process, along with an article describing this case and its usage: [How We Boosted Moving Flutter Widgets to Widgetbook](https://leancode.co/blog/moving-flutter-widgets-to-widgetbook?utm_source=widgetbook&utm_medium=docspage).
