# Review (beta)

> **NOTE:** Since the Review feature is currently in beta, we're not aiming to migrate any data created previous to the official (non-beta) release to make changes to the feature easier for our development team.

The Widgetbook Cloud _Review_ feature (currently in beta) allows teams to review added, changed or removed components.
The Review feature closely relates to reviews known from Pull-Requests. 
For each Pull-Request, our new `widgetbook` CLI analyzes the changes to your Widgetbook and creates a review.
Members of a frontend-team now can review each _changed_ use-case in isolation and add comments for other team members.

Once all changes from the review are accepted, a developer closes the Pull-Request and the review's status gets updated to `merged`.
For this to work, a webhook to our services is required.

## Requirements

To use Widgetbook Cloud _Review_ your setup has to meet the following requirements:
- Use [widgetbook_generator package](https://pub.dev/packages/widgetbook_generator) in version `v3.0.0-beta` (no special configuration required).
- Use [widgetbook package](https://pub.dev/packages/widgetbook) in version `v3.0.0-beta` (no special configuration required).
- Use the `widgetbook` CLI from the [widgetbook_cli package](https://pub.dev/packages/widgetbook_cli).
- Setup a GitHub webhook

# How the Review feature works

A Widgetbook Review allows Flutter teams to compare changes in the user interface.
Within the review the team compares the current version with a previous version. 
In addition, the review feature also offeres to compare the current version of a Widget with the Figma design of a component.

The structure of a review has similarities to the pull request workflow.
In a pull request developers compare a `base` branch (previous version) with a `feature` branch (new version) based on the lines of code changed.
For the review, our integration creates a Widgetbook Cloud review for each pull request in your Git provider.
Similar to how the previous code is compared to the current code on a line by line basis, in Widgetbook Cloud teams compare a base build (previous version) with a feature build (current version) on a visual use-case basis.
Therefore, Widgetbook Cloud requires an uploaded build for the base branch and feature branch.

## Builds for review
Use the [widgetbook_cli package](https://pub.dev/packages/widgetbook_cli) to upload a build for the base and feature branch.

<Tabs
  values={[
    { label: 'Upload base build', value: 'base' },
    { label: 'Upload feature build', value: 'feature' },
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="base">
    Define a CI/CD pipeline that uploads a build for each push to your base branch.
    The base branch is likely your `main`, `master`, `dev` or `staging` branch.

    ```bash title="CI/CD upload base build"
    # Install dependencies
    flutter pub get
    # Run the build runner
    flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
    # Build the Widgetbook
    flutter build web -t lib/app.widgetbook.dart
    # Install the CLI
    dart pub global activate widgetbook_cli 3.0.0-beta.22
    # Run the CLI
    widgetbook publish --api-key API-KEY
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="feature">
    Define a CI/CD pipeline that uploads a build for each push to your pull request.
    The feature branch can be any branch that is merged into your base branch.
    The base branch is likely your `main`, `master`, `dev` or `staging` branch.

    <Info>
        To successfully upload review information you must define the `--base-branch` argument for the Widgetbook CLI.
    </Info>

    ```bash title="CI/CD upload feature build and review"
    # Install dependencies
    flutter pub get
    # Run the build runner
    flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
    # Build the Widgetbook
    flutter build web -t lib/app.widgetbook.dart
    # Install the CLI
    dart pub global activate widgetbook_cli 3.0.0-beta.22
    # Run the CLI
    widgetbook publish --api-key API-KEY --base-branch BASE-BRANCH
    ```

    <Info>
        All CI/CD provider expose the `BASE-BRANCH` via environment variables for pull requests. 
        Please have a look at our [CI/CD provider examples](/widgetbook-cloud/hosting#examples).
    </Info> 
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Review information

In addition to the required builds, a review has to be populated with information about which use-cases changed.
The information on which use-cases changed is extracted by the CLI when the `--base-branch` argument is specified.

<Info>
    Widgetbook Cloud shows Reviews for each pull-request. 
    However, only Reviews that have changes to use-cases are accessible.
</Info>

<Warning>
    Currently, Widgetbook Cloud only shows use-cases that have been changed, added or removed within the freature branch in comparison to the base branch. 
    That means, that already existing use-cases will not be shown even if they have never been reviewed.
</Warning>

## Setup Webhook (GitHub)

A GitHub Webhook allows Widgetbook Cloud to receive information about changes within your repository.
Widgetbook Cloud can automatically set the state of a Review to `closed` or `merged` when a corresponding Pull-Request is `closed` or `merged`.
For this to work, you need to configure a webhook. 
See [Setting up a webhook](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/creating-webhooks#setting-up-a-webhook) for instructions on how to do this.

### Requirements

You need to meet the following requirements to setup a webhook to Widgetbook Cloud:
- Webhook Secret
- Payload URL

### Obtaining the Webhook Secret

The webhook secret can be obtained by going to the project overview and click the `Get secret` button within the webhook card.

### Setting up the webhook

1. Go to https://github.com/user-name/repo-name/settings/hooks. Make sure to replace `user-name` and `repo-name` with your appropriate values.
1. Click `Add webhook`
1. Paste `https://api.widgetbook.io/v1/webhooks/github` into the `Payload URL` field.
1. Set `Content type` to `application/json`
1. Paste your Widgetbook Cloud webhook secret into the `Secret` field.
