# Builds

When you create a new commit in git, a new version of your code is created. 
With Widgetbook builds developers make the new version of their local Widgetbook accessible for the whole team. 
If set up with CI/CD, you can have a build for each commit, for each pull-request or for each branch.

## Build process

Widgetbook Cloud builds have to be uploaded based on a Flutter web build. 
To create a Flutter web build, follow these steps:
1. Locate your Widgetbook project
1. Run the build runner by using `flutter pub run build_runner build -d`
1. Run `flutter build web -t widgetbook.dart`

## Publish a build

A Flutter web build of Widgetbook is published by using the [Widgetbook CLI](/widgetbook-cli/overview). 
An API key is required to publish a build.
See [How to Create an API Key](/widgetbook-cloud/setup/How-to-Create-an-API-Key) for more information.

To publish a build, follow these steps:
1. Activate the CLI by running `pub global activate widgetbook_cli`
1. Run `widgetbook publish --api-key API-KEY`

Feel free to customize the `publish` command by reading into the [CLI arguments](widgetbook-cli/overview#arguments).

<Info>
    Publishing builds with the CI/CD is recommended as the setup is less error prone and more autonomous. 
    See [CI/CD Setup](/widgetbook-cloud/setup) for more information.
