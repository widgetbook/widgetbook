# Knobs

Knobs are powerful features in Widgetbook that empower developers to customize
user interactions with a component's use-case.

They enable users to modify the parameters of a use-case, facilitating testing
under various inputs and states. Knobs significantly enhance the understanding
of a component's functionality by allowing dynamic parameter adjustments.

Developers and designers can gain more insight into how a component behaves
under different conditions, leading to a more robust and well-rounded component
design.

[Follow the documentation](/knobs/overview) to understand how to configure
knobs.
