# Monorepo vs. Polyrepo: An Introduction

Let's have a quick overview of the two prominent strategies that developers use
to manage codebase and repositories, the Monorepo and Polyrepo approaches. Both
have their advantages and disadvantages. Let's delve deeper into what each of
these means.

Monorepo A Monorepo (Monolithic Repository) is a software development strategy
where code for many projects is stored in the same repository.

```bash
/my_project
|
|-- /packages
|   |
|   |-- /shared_ui
|   |   |-- /lib
|   |
|   |-- /share_helpers
|   |   |-- /lib
|   |
|   |-- /shared_models
|       |-- /lib
|
|-- /apps
    |
    |-- /main_app
        |-- /lib
```

There are a few advantages:

1. **Unified Versioning**: Every commit can potentially represent a version
   across all projects.
2. **Code Sharing**: It's easier to reuse code across projects.
3. **Unified Build & Test**: All projects can be built, tested, and deployed
   together ensuring compatibility.
4. **Refactoring**: Changes across multiple projects can be done atomically.

It's also worth mentioning the disadvantages:

1. **Size**: As more and more projects get added, the repo size can become
   unwieldy.
2. **Build Times**: Without careful management, build times can increase.
3. **Access Control**: It might be challenging to control access to different
   parts of the repo.
4. **Overhead**: Initial setup and tooling can be more complex.

A Polyrepo (Multiple Repositories) approach means having individual repositories
for each project. This is the traditional method and is used by many
organizations of all sizes.

```bash
/my_shared_ui_repo
|
|-- /lib
```

```bash
/my_shared_ui_repo
|
|-- /lib
```

```bash
/my_shared_models_repo
|
|-- /lib
```

```bash
/my_shared_helpers_repo
|
|-- /lib
```

```bash
/my_main_app_repo
|
|-- /lib
```

Let's take a look at the some advantages:

1. **Isolation**: Each project is isolated, reducing the risk of one project
   affecting another.
2. **Simplicity**: Each repo has its own build, test, and deployment pipeline,
   making setups straightforward.
3. **Access Control**: Easier to control who has access to what.
4. **Focused**: Developers can focus on a specific project without unnecessary
   distractions.

Like other approaches, there are disadvantages to this setup:

1. **Code Duplication**: There might be redundant code across repositories.
2. **Dependency Management**: It can be a challenge to manage cross-repo
   dependencies. Atomic
3. **Refactoring**: Refactoring across multiple projects can be complex and
   non-atomic.
4. **Versioning**: Each repo might have its versioning, making it hard to have a
   unified view.

The decision between Monorepo and Polyrepo often depends on the organization's
scale, structure, and specific needs. It's vital to weigh the pros and cons
based on your development environment, team size, and project requirements.
